# The-Ultimate-DnD-Tool-TUDT-
IT'S FINALY DONE! A tool that is 3 in 1 for D&amp;D! 1203 lines in all! 563 code & 640 csv. If you want to turn this program into an exe, put the csv and py files in a folder. Enter the windows computer command prompt and type "pip install pyinstaller" you will need python 3.9.12 for this to work I think, enter the folder that has the files and in the top area where you enter a path, type cmd. This will open a new cmd prompt directed to the path, now in the command prompt type "pyinstaller --onefile <the py file name, in this case it is TUDT.py>" boom, now in the file with the csv and py file, there will be a build folder, delete it, and there will be a dist folder, open it, in the dist folder there should be the .exe file.
